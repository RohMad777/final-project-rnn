              Currently, internet users in the world continue to experience rapid technological developments. 
              This increase is one of the factors that trigger the evolution of social media and e-commerce. 
              This evolution has led to an increase in the amount of information that is quite large or better 
              known as big data. Today, information is a very important source for making decisions, 
              such as information about product reviews and ratings. 
              Product reviews and ratings are very useful information for consumers to make decisions. 
              Therefore, sentiment analysis is currently an interesting topic to study. 
              Sentiment analysis is one of the research areas in the field of NLP (Natural Language Processing) 
              which classifies user reviews into positive and negative reviews. 
              Sentiment analysis is the study of user reviews about the products or entities they use, 
              such as food, hotels, airlines, etc. 
              Many start-up companies in the field of e-commerce are competing to make online store applications, 
              for example Tokopedia is the online store with the most visitors, which is more than 100 million 
              visitors per month during the fourth quarter of 2018, beating several other online stores.
